Many existing productivity applications can be either overly complex or too simplistic, failing to provide a balanced and functional solution for daily task management. Users often need a straightforward platform to organize their tasks without unnecessary bloat, ensuring efficient tracking and completion.

Objective
The primary objective of this project was to build a functional and user-friendly to-do list application that empowers users to effectively manage their tasks.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks that are no longer relevant.
Mark as Complete: Toggle tasks between pending and completed states.
Task Filtering: Filter tasks to view "All," "Pending," or "Completed" items.
Local Storage Persistence: All tasks are automatically saved in the browser's localStorage, ensuring data persists even after closing and reopening the browser.
Responsive Design: The user interface is fully responsive and adapts gracefully to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
Date/Time Stamps (Optional/Implemented): Each task includes a timestamp indicating when it was added, providing better context.
Technologies Used
